Pheph
============
Post hoc ergo propter hoc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
For experiment design.
Pheph is a Python module for Approximate explanatory variable â†’ objective variable with ML,DL or others and then,
the optimum objective variable is found by GA using the evaluation function made from the objective variable.

It is currently maintained by a rtafds.


Installation
------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Phepe requires:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy (>= 1.12.0)
- Pandas (>= 0.21.0)

and classes end with "Display") require Matplotlib (>= 1.5.1) or Plotly.
A few examples require pandas >= 0.18.0.

Development
-----------

I welcome new contributors of all experience levels. 
And I have a hard time collecting data for transfer learning, so if datasetsIf you look for or find data, it will be helpful.
Any field is acceptable, but I want the experimental data on chemistry and materials.
