Original Description: Compilation of colony forming unit data for Bacillus anthracis and B. atrophaeus before and after exposure to various fogging treatments using peracetic acid or hydrogen peroxide

Data set contains CFU data for positive controls and test coupons for each test, for each material, and for each microorganism used. Also included are efficacy data in terms of log reductions. It also includes data on process and environmental conditions during fogging. This dataset is associated with the following publication: Richter, W., J. Wood, M. Wendling, and J. Rogers. Inactivation of Bacillus anthracis spores to decontaminate subway railcar and related materials via the fogging of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide sporicidal liquids.
